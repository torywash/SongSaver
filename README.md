# SongSaver
An HTML, CSS, and JS built website which takes a song name, artist, and your review of the song and stores it for later. You can use it to look back and find your classics, or save a new song to remind yourself why you love it.

# _Resources_
_I used Claude.ai to debug, and ChatGPT to create the color palette, otherwise the project was built entirely by me._
